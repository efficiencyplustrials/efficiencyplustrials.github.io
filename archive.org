** Meeting notes
*** Publication
  Following Inna's suggestion at our last general meeting, we should
 set a 2026 goal to publish a special issue in a cross-function
 journal, and in addition to 1. Therapeutic innovation and Regulatory
 Science, 2. Clinical Trials, Jose' suggested 3. Statistics in
 Biopharmaceutical Research, an ASA journal.  Oor timeline should aim
 to put out a special issue toward end of 2026, which means we need to
 start contacting the journals early next year.
*** RISW 2026
  Fei will put together an invited session proposal (submission window
  is December 17, 2025 - January 14, 2026).  Per CG's suggestion, we
  should propose a session to introduce SWG and operational related
  topics to regulatory participants and pique their interest for
  participation, one possibility is to link the session to ICH-E6
  guideline. We discussed the possibility to invite a speaker from
  health authorities, following up on two previous leads (Robert
  Abugov, FDA and Benjamin Hofner, EMA). CG and Fei will work on how
  best to frame the session proposal and engage them.

  Potential session speakers are Dooti, Guohui, Jose'
  
*** SWG Annual Report
  We also discussed a request from SWG chair Yodit Seifu on an annual
   SWG report, who's asking about mechanisms to admit new members as
   well as term limits for chairs.

 Kyle Wathen proposed that we should revisit Efficiency+ team roster
 and confirm participation come January 2027 and remove those who do
 not have the bandwith to actively participate.

 CG also suggested formation of a committee for Efficiency+ that can
 meet more frequently to discuss logistics such as membership to the
 group. Currenly the co-chairs (Fei/Clara/Inna) have a reguarly
 monthly meeting. Perhaps that is sufficient for now.

 Lastly, Eff+ dose have advisory roles (Jose', Benjamin) and we should
consider finding more advisors from academia. It is thus far unclear
how to best engage our advisors. Fei will work with co-chairs on this.

### **SWG Annual Report**

We reviewed a request from SWG Chair **Yodit Seifu** regarding the
annual SWG report, specifically asking about:

*   Mechanisms for admitting new members
*   Term limits for chairs

Kyle Wathen proposed revisiting the **Efficiency+ team roster** in
January 2027 to confirm participation and remove members who lack
bandwidth for active involvement.

CG suggested forming an **Efficiency+ committee** to meet more
frequently and address logistics such as membership. Currently, the
co-chairs (Fei, Clara, Inna) hold a regular monthly meeting, which may
suffice for now.

Lastly, Efficiency+ has advisory roles (Jose', Benjamin), and we should
consider adding more advisors from academia. It remains unclear how
best to engage advisors—Fei will work with co-chairs to address this.

*   Robert Abugov (FDA)
*   Benjamin Hofner (EMA)

CG and Fei will collaborate on framing the proposal and engaging these potential speakers.  
Additional potential speakers include **Dooti, Guohui, and Jose**.

*** GPT version:

### **Publication**

Following Inna’s suggestion at our last general meeting, we propose
setting a 2026 goal to publish a **special issue in a cross-functional
journal**. In addition to *Therapeutic Innovation and Regulatory
Science* and *Clinical Trials*, Jose suggested including *Statistics
in Biopharmaceutical Research* (an ASA journal).

Our timeline should target releasing the special issue toward the
**end of 2026**, which means we need to begin contacting journals
**early next year**.


### **RISW 2026**

Fei will prepare an **invited session proposal** (submission window:
**December 17, 2025 – January 14, 2026**).

Per CG’s suggestion, the session should introduce SWG and operational
topics to regulatory participants and spark interest in future
engagement. One idea is to **link the session to the ICH-E6
guideline**.


We also discussed inviting a speaker from health authorities, following up on two previous leads:

*** SWG Annual Report
We reviewed a request from SWG Chair **Yodit Seifu** regarding the
annual SWG report, specifically asking about:
 - Mechanisms for admitting new members
    
 - Term limits for chairs: staggered/rotation

  We also discussed a request from SWG chair Yodit Seifu on an annual
   SWG report, who's asking about mechanisms to admit new members as
   well as term limits for chairs.

   Kyle Wathen proposed that we should revisit Efficiency+ team roster
   and confirm participation come January 2027 and remove those who do
   not have the bandwith to actively participate.

   CG also suggested formation of a committee for Efficiency+ that can
   meet more frequently to discuss logistics such as membership to the
   group. Currenly the co-chairs (Fei/Clara/Inna) have a reguarly
   monthly meeting. Perhaps that is sufficient for now.

   Lastly, Eff+ dose have advisory roles (Jose', Benjamin) and we should
   consider finding more advisors from academia/HA/CRO. It is thus far unclear
   how to best engage our advisors. Fei will work with co-chairs on this.

 
** 2026 deliverables
*** White paper
  Following Inna's suggestion at our last general meeting, we should
 set a 2026 goal to publish a special issue in a cross-function
 journal, and in addition to
 
 1. Therapeutic innovation and Regulatory Science,
 2. Clinical Trials
 3. Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research
 4. CRO's perspective on best journal # clara and fei to do research  on (IQVIA publication?)
 5. medical journals to reach clinical audience? (possibility for next  year 2027, short publication)
    
   our timeline should aim
 to put out a special issue toward end of 2026, which means we need to
 start contacting the journals early next year.

     Dear Fei,
     
     I wanted to share some updates on the subgroup Study Design and
    Operations Impact. We had our first meeting couple of weeks back
    and had productive discussions on what the group could focus on
    this year. The group will meet once a month for an hour and work
    async.
     
     The consensus was the following:
     
     	Expanding Group Membership to Cross-Functional Stakeholders:
    This group can only be successful with cross-functional
    feedback. We will reach out to operations, drug supply, and other
    affected functions to seek their inputs and experiences while
    implementing adaptive designs.
    
     	First focus on inferential seamless 2/3 designs and
    understanding implementational challenges from 360 view
    cross-functionally from various sponsors. The intent would be
    writing a manuscript (and presentations) to share the learnings
    and if possible, workaround solutions.
    
     	Share broadly in conferences: At the least this should promote
    a novel and broad lens understanding for statisticians when they
    are proposing such designs and it can serve as way to explain
    benefits of such designs to non-statistical colleagues.
     
     I recently had a major role change, and my schedule is crazy between work travels. This should all calm down in the next few weeks. 
     I have asked Jessica to represent us in tomorrow's meeting and provide an update in my absence. In case she is not there, please help me share the above update with the rest of the team. 
     
     Looking forward to the exciting year!

    I will not be able to attend tomorrow's general meeting and our
    previous Clinical Trials Supply Chain meeting was cancelled so
    there aren't really any new updates.  The only thing that was
    passed along was the template/sample information collection
    document I created to have a standard way to collect information
    for our pilot example trials.  Our next meeting we will go through
    that document and create a plan for how to implement the simple
    trial Allison developed for us.
