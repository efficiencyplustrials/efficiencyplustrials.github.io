** Meeting notes
*** Publication
  Following Inna's suggestion at our last general meeting, we should
 set a 2026 goal to publish a special issue in a cross-function
 journal, and in addition to 1. Therapeutic innovation and Regulatory
 Science, 2. Clinical Trials, Jose' suggested 3. Statistics in
 Biopharmaceutical Research, an ASA journal.  Oor timeline should aim
 to put out a special issue toward end of 2026, which means we need to
 start contacting the journals early next year.
*** RISW 2026
  Fei will put together an invited session proposal (submission window
  is December 17, 2025 - January 14, 2026).  Per CG's suggestion, we
  should propose a session to introduce SWG and operational related
  topics to regulatory participants and pique their interest for
  participation, one possibility is to link the session to ICH-E6
  guideline. We discussed the possibility to invite a speaker from
  health authorities, following up on two previous leads (Robert
  Abugov, FDA and Benjamin Hofner, EMA). CG and Fei will work on how
  best to frame the session proposal and engage them.

  Potential session speakers are Dooti, Guohui, Jose'
  
*** SWG Annual Report
  We also discussed a request from SWG chair Yodit Seifu on an annual
   SWG report, who's asking about mechanisms to admit new members as
   well as term limits for chairs.

 Kyle Wathen proposed that we should revisit Efficiency+ team roster
 and confirm participation come January 2027 and remove those who do
 not have the bandwith to actively participate.

 CG also suggested formation of a committee for Efficiency+ that can
 meet more frequently to discuss logistics such as membership to the
 group. Currenly the co-chairs (Fei/Clara/Inna) have a reguarly
 monthly meeting. Perhaps that is sufficient for now.

 Lastly, Eff+ dose have advisory roles (Jose', Benjamin) and we should
consider finding more advisors from academia. It is thus far unclear
how to best engage our advisors. Fei will work with co-chairs on this.



*** GPT version:

### **Publication**

Following Inna’s suggestion at our last general meeting, we propose
setting a 2026 goal to publish a **special issue in a cross-functional
journal**. In addition to *Therapeutic Innovation and Regulatory
Science* and *Clinical Trials*, Jose suggested including *Statistics
in Biopharmaceutical Research* (an ASA journal).

Our timeline should target releasing the special issue toward the
**end of 2026**, which means we need to begin contacting journals
**early next year**.


### **RISW 2026**

Fei will prepare an **invited session proposal** (submission window:
**December 17, 2025 – January 14, 2026**).

Per CG’s suggestion, the session should introduce SWG and operational
topics to regulatory participants and spark interest in future
engagement. One idea is to **link the session to the ICH-E6
guideline**.


We also discussed inviting a speaker from health authorities, following up on two previous leads:

*   Robert Abugov (FDA)
*   Benjamin Hofner (EMA)

CG and Fei will collaborate on framing the proposal and engaging these potential speakers.  
Additional potential speakers include **Dooti, Guohui, and Jose**.

***

### **SWG Annual Report**

We reviewed a request from SWG Chair **Yodit Seifu** regarding the
annual SWG report, specifically asking about:

*   Mechanisms for admitting new members
*   Term limits for chairs

Kyle Wathen proposed revisiting the **Efficiency+ team roster** in
January 2027 to confirm participation and remove members who lack
bandwidth for active involvement.

CG suggested forming an **Efficiency+ committee** to meet more
frequently and address logistics such as membership. Currently, the
co-chairs (Fei, Clara, Inna) hold a regular monthly meeting, which may
suffice for now.

Lastly, Efficiency+ has advisory roles (Jose', Benjamin), and we should
consider adding more advisors from academia. It remains unclear how
best to engage advisors—Fei will work with co-chairs to address this.
