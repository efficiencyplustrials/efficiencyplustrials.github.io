  #+TBLFM: $1=@#-1

** FDA withdrew due to bandwidth
 Abugov, Robert
** PEI contact gained
 Benjamin Hofner
** Meeting Frequency Proposal
 - Every two weeks for now to get started 
 - Slow down to once a month in 6-12 months
 - Slow further once sub workstreams gain momentum
** ICH E20 adaptive design comments
 Propose change to section 5.6
 Propose to add the following paragraph to this section:
 
 Adaptations in clinical trials inherently introduce unpredictable
 demands on drug supply, potentially causing delays that adversely
 impact trial timelines. This challenge presents a significant
 opportunity to underscore the crucial role of operational planning in
 adaptive design strategies. An enhanced focus should be placed on
 thoroughly assessing the operational characteristics—specifically
 examining the impacts of adaptations on drug supply, randomization
 processes, data quality, and considerations for Multi-Regional
 Clinical Trials (MRCT), Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCT) and
 Pragmatic Clinical Trials (PCT). When evaluating the benefits and
 drawbacks of adaptive designs in contrast to traditional approaches,
 these operational aspects are pivotal. Moreover, the introduction of
 a 'design for adaptive operations' should be championed, ensuring
 that operational planning is as rigorously conceived as the
 statistical methods detailed in this guidance document. Doing so will
 help align operational strategies with statistical rigor to optimize
 trial efficiency and mitigate risks associated with supply
 fluctuations and other operational challenges.
