** Data-driven Approaches

- **Site Performance & Selection**
  - Bohdana Ratitch: Suitable predictive analytics/ML for site performance modeling
  - Palani Ravindran: Data privacy/access impacts; leveraging RWD/external data for site identification
  - Zhuoxin Yu: Use of public/commercial databases for site/investigator/study committee selection
  - Bochao Jia: Evaluating site performance from operational and data quality perspectives


** Recruitment Monitoring & Forecasting

- **Enrollment & Projection Methods**
  - Haoyu Wang: Predicting enrollment with slow/fast scenarios
  - Tobias Straubinger: Best models for recruitment; improving with trial history data
  - Fei Chen: Combining sources for forecasting (actuals, historical, local, baseline)
  - Bochao Jia: Differentiating screening/enrollment projections and time to completion


** Study Design & Operational Impact

- **Innovative Design Implementation**
  - Haoyu Wang: Streamlining innovative/inferential seamless designs in face of operational challenges
  - Forrest Williamson: (No explicit question, but implied study design/operations interface)
 

** Operational Efficiencies in Non-traditional Trials

- **Decentralized, Pragmatic, and Observational Trials**
  - Jun Xing: Designing DCTs/PCTs to balance feasibility, efficacy-effectiveness gap, and data quality in real-world settings


** Representativeness & Generalizability

- **Population Monitoring**
  - Bohdana Ratitch: Dynamically monitoring trial participant characteristics for representativeness; setting site enrollment targets to match population objectives


** Clinical Drug Supply Optimization

- **Forecasting & Stakeholder Engagement**
  - Kaifeng Lu: Improving assumptions/forecasts for supply disruptions (discontinuation, skip visits)
  - Fei Chen: Overview/practical guidelines for 4C and other supply forecast tools; simulation platforms for drug supply planning; showing statistical value via retrospective analysis


** Dynamic Trial Monitoring & Adaptive Operations

- **Predictive Monitoring & Techniques**
  - Palani Ravindran: Most predictive operational metrics and AI/ML techniques for ongoing risk detection
  - Zhuoxin Yu: Better prediction/monitoring of events and dropouts (study/regional/site levels)


** Regulatory Perspectives

- **Operational Planning in Study Design**
  - Fei Chen: Advocating for operational planning rigor in regulatory guidelines (adaptive designs, MRCT, DCT, PCT)
  - Reference to ICH E20 and operational challenges introduced by adaptations in trials


** Stakeholder Engagement

- **Collaboration & Change Management**
  - Fei Chen: Collaborating across teams/functions, convincing stakeholders to embrace change
  - Fei Chen: Showing value via counter-factual analysis/retrospective workflow insights


** Strategic Data Collection & Analysis Planning

**Sample Collection for Target Product Profile**
  - Zhuoxin Yu: Best strategy for blood sample collection – optimize amount while maintaining data quality for PK, ADA, biomarkers
