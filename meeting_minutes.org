   With over two decades of experience in the pharmaceutical industry,
   I currently lead statistical modeling and simulations at BeOne
   (formerly BeiGene. I have developed methodologies and created an
   internal R Shiny tool for drug demand forecasting. I am also keen
   to explore statistical innovations in site selection and
   performance assessment. I believe these areas hold significant
   potential for improving trial outcomes, and I would welcome the

    I am part of a working group put together by FDA on aligning Bayesian models with expert opinion, which I believe is a project of the ASA Pediatric Working Group. The main driver is Bob Abugov (Robert.Abugov@fda.hhs.gov). Feel free to reach out. You can copy me and mention my recommendation. Cathy Lee also sent me an FDA announcement for a Bayesian Statistical Analysis (BSA) Demonstration Project (see Bayesian Statistical Analysis (BSA) Demonstration Project | FDA). The operational angle suggests more complex adaptive designs which may be more suited for the CID program. https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-resources/complex-innovative-trial-design-meeting-program. 
    Reach out to me once you get it started. I am always interested in
   innovative statistical approaches, but whether I can be of help
   remains an open question.

**** Session Title
Enhancing Clinical Trial Efficiency through Statistics, AI, and
Collaborative Innovation
**** Session Motivation
The session will highlight state-of-the-art statistical methods and
operational strategies to improve the efficiency of clinical trial
execution, focusing on clinical study operational areas such as trial
feasibility assessment, site selection and performance evaluation,
patient recruitment planning and tracking, and clinical drug
supply. The presentations will explore innovative analytical
methodologies at the intersection of several fields, including
Bayesian modeling, Data Science and AI/ML, clinical trial simulation,
and data visualization, leveraging real-world and clinical trial data
to maximize operational efficiency and excellence. The session aims to
facilitate the exchange of insights, experiences, and best practices
among statisticians from industry, academia and government, with the
ultimate goal of establishing an area of methodological research and
application focused on the optimization of clinical trial processes
and outcomes.

**** Role of Statistics in an AI-augmented World is our theme for 2026. Please briefly explain how your proposal relates to this theme.

This invited session exemplifies the evolving role of statistics in an
AI-augmented world by showcasing how statistical thinking, when
combined with AI and data science, transforms clinical trial
operations. Across all session topics—feasibility, monitoring,
pediatric research, and software development—the use of AI-enhanced
predictive modeling, Bayesian learning, and real-time analytics is
central. These technologies do not replace statistical reasoning but
rather augment it, enabling: • More adaptive, real-time
decision-making in trial monitoring using AI-assisted dashboards and
Bayesian posterior updates; • Improved patient recruitment planning
and site performance prediction via machine learning models trained on
historical and real-world data; • Smart software systems that blend
AI-based forecasts with statistical uncertainty quantification for
robust feasibility planning; Importantly, the session emphasizes the
collaborative interplay between human-guided statistical insight and
machine-driven data synthesis, as clinical operation is inherently a
human endeavor with collaborations across different groups of a
company, statistics, drug supply, trial execution, regulatory,
etc. making it a model case study for how statisticians are redefining
their role in the AI age — not as passive provider of algorithmic
outputs, but as architects of responsible, interpretable, and
operationally impactful AI systems in the biopharmaceutical domain.

Methods in Trial Monitoring and Operational Excellence: An Overview

Operational monitoring in clinical trials is critical to ensuring data
quality and achieving successful outcomes. This presentation will
discuss innovative methodologies that leverage predictive analytics,
AI/ML algorithms, and Bayesian frameworks to enhance trial
monitoring. Emphasis will be placed on integrating tools like Quality
Tolerance Limits for tracking site performance, participant
compliance, and data reporting accuracy. Additionally, innovations in
data visualization and analytics enhance the ability to detect early
warning signs of inefficiencies in participant recruitment, protocol
adherence, and data accuracy. By integrating these methods with modern
operational frameworks, trial teams can transition from reactive to
proactive strategies, enabling agile decision-making and resource
allocation. This overview highlights the transformative potential of
evidence-based monitoring methodologies in ensuring trial success
while maintaining high standards of quality and efficiency.

Advanced Data-Driven Statistical Technologies for Designing and
Forecasting Clinical Trial Operations

Designing and forecasting clinical trial operations remains one of the
most pressing challenges in modern drug development, with inefficient
patient enrollment being a leading contributor to costly delays. This
talk presents recent advances in statistical and analytic
methodologies aimed at improving the predictability and efficiency of
clinical trial execution. We introduce innovative data-driven
technologies that enhance recruitment forecasting by accounting for
key sources of uncertainty, including variability in site activation
timelines, heterogeneous enrollment rates across sites, and temporal
stochasticity. These models enable dynamic, stage-specific projections
that better align operational plans with real-world trial behavior. A
framework for optimizing cost-efficient recruitment strategies through
intelligent site and country selection is also presented. This
methodology incorporates operational constraints such as regional
enrollment caps and cost differentials to balance feasibility and
resource allocation. Interim reforecasting approaches that leverage
accumulating data to adaptively adjust recruitment plans are discussed
with the goal of maximizing the probability of meeting enrollment
milestones. Additionally, statistical techniques for centralized
monitoring are introduced to identify atypical performance patterns,
flagging under- or over-performing sites and informing operational
interventions. The talk also covers methods for forecasting key
operational metrics critical to trial planning and oversight—such as
projecting event accrual in oncology trials. The utility of these
approaches is demonstrated through real-world case studies that
illustrate their application in complex, global clinical programs.

Challenges of Pediatric Studies: Unlocking Opportunities for
Operational Innovation

Pediatric clinical trials face unique challenges, including limited
patient populations, heightened ethical considerations, and complex
regulatory environments. This talk will explore how to overcome these
obstacles by employing advanced statistical methodologies and
strategic trial designs. I will touch upon topics including
recruitment strategies tailored to pediatric populations, predictive
modeling for identifying suitable sites, and integrating patient and
caregiver feedback into trial planning.

Complexities of Randomization Setup in Platform Trials: A
Statistician’s Perspective

Platform trials have emerged as an innovative and resource-efficient
design strategy in clinical research, enabling the simultaneous
evaluation of multiple interventions in a perpetual fashion. While
this adaptive design can accelerate the process of identifying
effective interventions, it also introduces notable operational
challenges. This presentation reflects statistical contributions in
platform trial design and conduct, with a focus on the IRT and
randomization setup. Key topics include: (1) the increased complexity
associated with different entry criteria across arms, including but
not limited to “recycling” patients and their treatment assignment
other than previously participated and failed; and (2) the need to
dynamically update randomization schedules to accommodate the addition
and/or removal of trial arms during trial conduct, with considerations
for optimal timing and allocation ratios. Our discussion aims to
highlight practical strategies for overcoming these challenges,
ensuring trial integrity and efficiency throughout the adaptive
process.
