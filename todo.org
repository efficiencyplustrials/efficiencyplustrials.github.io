  Please enter your name under each focus area if you are interested to actively contribute to the workstream 
   (Please see the SWG proposal (Presentations/Proposal for a Scientific Working Group_submitted_2.pdf) for 
    details on what wasoriginally envisaged under each focus area.)

  Please also enter ONE key question that would be most important for you to address under the focus area
  that you would like to contribute to.

1. Site selection and performance modeling using data-driven approaches

  + Bohdana Ratitch: Which predictive analytics and ML approaches are the most suitable and effective 
    for data-driven site performance modeling?

2. Recruitment monitoring and forecasting: best practices and tools
  + Haoyu Wang: How best to predict enrollment given too slow/too fast scenarios are not uncommon at all?
  + Tobias Straubinger: What are the best-suited models for recruitment, which parameters improve the model and how can historic trial performance be used for future trial performance forecasting?

3. Study design and its impact on operations
  + Haoyu Wang: How to further facilitate/simplify/remove hurdles when implementing innovative designs (e.g., inferential seamless) given current operational challenges/complexities?

  + Forrest Williamson:

4. Operational efficiencies in non-traditional trial settings (e.g., DCTs, PCTs) 
  + Jun Xing: How can we design and implement decentralized, pragmatic, and observational trials in a way that optimally balances operational feasibility, gap between trail design assumptions between efficacy and effectiveness, and struggle to maintain high data quality, while aligning with real-world clinical practice?

5. Ensuring representativeness of trial populations and generalizability

  + Bohdana Ratitch: How to dynamically monitor characteristics of participants enrolled in a clinical trial 
    with respect to the key characteristics of the target population and provide site enrollment targets for an ongoing trial to meet population representativeness objectives?

6. Clinical drug supply optimization for just-in-time supply models

7. Strategic data collection and analysis planning for alignment with Target Product Profile

8. Patient engagement: and best practices for evaluating participant satisfaction

9. Analysis implementation efficiency
