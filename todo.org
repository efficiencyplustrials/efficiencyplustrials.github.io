5. Ensuring representativeness of trial populations and generalizability

  + Bohdana Ratitch: How to dynamically monitor characteristics of participants enrolled in a clinical trial 
    with respect to the key characteristics of the target population and provide site enrollment targets for an ongoing trial to meet population representativeness objectives?
