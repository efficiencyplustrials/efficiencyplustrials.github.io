### **Abstracts for Each Topic**

#### **1. Site Selection and Performance Modeling: Predictive Analytics/ML and RWD Integration**
Optimizing site selection is critical for accelerating trial timelines
and ensuring data quality. This talk will explore the use of
predictive analytics and machine learning to model site performance,
leveraging historical trial data and real-world data (RWD) to identify
high-performing sites. The integration of external data sources
enables a more nuanced understanding of site capabilities, patient
availability, and operational risk. Presenters will share case studies
demonstrating how these models have improved site activation speed,
enrollment rates, and overall trial efficiency.


#### **2. Recruitment Monitoring and Forecasting: Advanced Modeling Approaches**
Accurate recruitment forecasting is essential for proactive trial
management. This presentation will highlight advanced statistical
methods, including Poisson-gamma models and Bayesian approaches, to
monitor and predict recruitment trajectories under various
scenarios. These models allow for dynamic updates as new data becomes
available, enabling sponsors to anticipate delays, adjust strategies,
and allocate resources more effectively. Real-world applications will
illustrate how these techniques have reduced recruitment uncertainty
and improved trial planning.


#### **3. Dynamic Trial Monitoring: AI/ML for Emerging Risk Prediction**
Traditional trial monitoring often lags behind emerging risks. This
session will showcase how artificial intelligence and machine learning
can be used to detect operational and data integrity risks in real
time. By analyzing patterns in site behavior, patient data, and
protocol deviations, these models can flag potential issues before
they escalate. The discussion will include algorithm development,
validation strategies, and implementation challenges, with examples
from ongoing trials demonstrating improved oversight and risk
mitigation.


#### **4. Trial Population Representativeness: Dynamic Monitoring of Participant Characteristics**
Ensuring that trial populations reflect the diversity of the target
patient population is increasingly important for regulatory and
ethical reasons. This talk will present statistical frameworks for
dynamically monitoring participant characteristics—such as age,
gender, race, and comorbidities—throughout the enrollment
period. These methods support adaptive recruitment strategies and help
maintain representativeness across sites and regions. Case studies
will show how these tools have been used to enhance trial inclusivity
and generalizability of results.



Towards A Unified Modeling Framework for Patient Enrollment

Abstract
Robust and accurate enrollment forecasting plays a critical role in ensuring clinical trial success. From a portfolio management perspective, pre-study enrollment prediction helps stakeholders better understand recruitment timelines under "what if" scenarios and forecast clinical trial drug demand. Constrained by limited information, enrollment rate assumptions are typically based on historical data from similar previous trials and/or expert knowledge.
Once a study begins, accumulated patient enrollment data can be utilized to assess enrollment rate assumptions, providing operational insights and supporting data-informed decision-making. These insights enable prediction of future enrollment profiles, study timelines, and endpoint maturation—all critical factors for improving trial success.
Despite the key importance of patient enrollment prediction and its evolving methodological development, significant unmet needs remain for a unified modeling framework. Such a framework should account for heterogeneity from difference sources, incorporate spatial correlation of the underlying enrollment process among sites, and allow for dispersion flexibility.
Motivated by these needs, we propose a class of models that include commonly used Poisson and negative binomial models as special cases, while also incorporating other models with dispersion flexibility and spatial correlation. To facilitate efficient model estimation, we have developed customized algorithms that achieve fast and efficient estimation under the Bayesian paradigm. We provide examples demonstrating both the practical application of our proposed model and the efficiency of our algorithms.
