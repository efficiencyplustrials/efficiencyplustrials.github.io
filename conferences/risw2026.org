Efficiency+: Advanced Statistical Innovations Driving Clinical Trial Efficiency
 
The ICH E6(R3) guideline, "Guideline for Good Clinical Practice," highlights the importance of risk-proportional quality management, the reliability of results, and adaptability to digital and decentralized trial models. While these principles primarily focus on maintaining the data integrity and credibility of clinical trials, they also underscore the significant role of clinical operations. These guidelines serve as a foundational context for advanced statistical methods, which are key to enhancing trial operational efficiency and decision-making processes. This invited session brings together experts from regulatory agencies, academia, and industry to explore how innovative analytics can optimize critical operational domains in clinical trials. The session uses ICH-E6 principles as a contextual framework for discussing statistical advancements that enable smarter, faster, and more reliable trials.
 
Four talks are proposed to cover:
- Data-Driven Patient Recruitment: Statistical Approaches to Site Activation and Enrollment Forecasting – a comparative analysis of diverse statistical models designed to capture these processes
- Dynamic Trial Monitoring and Data Quality Strategies – integrating real-time analytics for risk-based oversight aligned with FDA initiatives such as C3TI SSDC.
- Interplay Between Statistical Design and Operational Execution – how design choices influence timelines and resource allocation, and vice versa.
- Clinical Supply Chain Optimization – probabilistic forecasting and simulation to ensure continuity and minimize waste.

The session will also have discussants offering insights on how these innovations intersect with regulatory review. By integrating biostatistics, clinical operations, regulatory science, and supply chain analytics, this session provides practical frameworks and case studies for statisticians, clinical operations leaders, and regulatory scientists.
 
Learning Objectives
- Understand how advanced statistical methods can improve operational efficiency in patient recruitment, monitoring, and supply chain management.
- Explore strategies for integrating real-time analytics into risk-based trial oversight.
- Examine the interplay between trial design and operational execution to optimize timelines and resources.

* Description

ICH‑E6(R3) emphasizes risk‑proportional quality management,
reliability of results, and adaptability to digital and decentralized
trial models. This invited session demonstrates how advanced
statistical methods can transform operational efficiency across
critical trial domains. Four talks will cover: (i) patient recruitment
monitoring and forecasting, including predictive site selection
models; (ii) dynamic trial monitoring and data quality strategies that
integrate real‑time analytics for risk‑based oversight; (iii) the
interplay between statistical design and operational execution,
highlighting how design choices influence timelines and resource
allocation-and vice versa; and (iv) clinical supply chain optimization
using probabilistic forecasting and simulation to ensure continuity
and minimize waste. This invited session will demonstrate how these
advanced statistical methods enable cross-disciplinary decision-making
in the context of ICH‑E6(R3) principles. By integrating biostatistics,
clinical operations, regulatory science, and supply chain analytics,
Each presentation will connect these innovations to ICH‑E6(R3)
principles, offering practical frameworks and case studies for
statisticians, clinical operations leaders, and regulatory scientists.

Subject: RISW 2026 Invited Session on ICH‑E6(R3) & Operational Efficiency

Dear Colleague,

I’m organizing a parallel session at RISW 2026 on “Quality by Design for Trial Operations:
Statistical Innovations Aligned to ICH‑E6(R3).” The goal is to showcase actionable analytics
that improve enrollment, monitoring, data governance, and decentralized operations in line
with E6(R3)’s principles and Annex guidance.

Would you be willing to present a 20–25 minute talk on [topic]? The session will include
industry, FDA, and (ideally) academia, with names kept out of the proposal per RISW rules.

Key dates: Proposal window closes January 14, 2026; workshop is Sept 16–18 (Rockville, MD).
I can share a brief outline and expected takeaways.

Thank you!
Fei
