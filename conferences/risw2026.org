* Description

ICH‑E6(R3) emphasizes risk‑proportional quality management,
reliability of results, and adaptability to digital and decentralized
trial models. This invited session demonstrates how advanced
statistical methods can transform operational efficiency across
critical trial domains. Four talks will cover: (i) patient recruitment
monitoring and forecasting, including predictive site selection
models; (ii) dynamic trial monitoring and data quality strategies that
integrate real‑time analytics for risk‑based oversight; (iii) the
interplay between statistical design and operational execution,
highlighting how design choices influence timelines and resource
allocation-and vice versa; and (iv) clinical supply chain optimization
using probabilistic forecasting and simulation to ensure continuity
and minimize waste. This invited session will demonstrate how these
advanced statistical methods enable cross-disciplinary decision-making
in the context of ICH‑E6(R3) principles. By integrating biostatistics,
clinical operations, regulatory science, and supply chain analytics,
Each presentation will connect these innovations to ICH‑E6(R3)
principles, offering practical frameworks and case studies for
statisticians, clinical operations leaders, and regulatory scientists.

* Audience

Subject: RISW 2026 Invited Session on ICH‑E6(R3) & Operational Efficiency

Dear Colleague,

I’m organizing a parallel session at RISW 2026 on “Quality by Design for Trial Operations:
Statistical Innovations Aligned to ICH‑E6(R3).” The goal is to showcase actionable analytics
that improve enrollment, monitoring, data governance, and decentralized operations in line
with E6(R3)’s principles and Annex guidance.

Would you be willing to present a 20–25 minute talk on [topic]? The session will include
industry, FDA, and (ideally) academia, with names kept out of the proposal per RISW rules.

Key dates: Proposal window closes January 14, 2026; workshop is Sept 16–18 (Rockville, MD).
I can share a brief outline and expected takeaways.

Thank you!
Fei
