Efficiency+ SWG: Improve Clinical Trial Operations through Advanced Statistics

The purpose of this session is to introduce the newly formed ASA
Biopharmaceutical Section Scientific Working Group on Operational
Efficiency, "Efficiency+." and promote awareness of the important
roles statisticians can play in clinical trial operations. The
initiative aims to foster collaboration among statisticians, clinical
trial operations professionals, and regulatory stakeholders to drive
innovative solutions and best practices. By bringing together diverse
expertise, "Efficiency+" hopes to facilitate knowledge exchange,
streamline operations, and develop data-driven strategies that will
ultimately accelerate the path to successful clinical outcomes.

The session will highlight state-of-the-art statistical methods and
operational strategies to improve the efficiency of clinical trial
execution, focusing on clinical study operational areas such as trial
feasibility assessment, patient recruitment planning and tracking, and clinical drug
supply. The presentations will explore innovative analytical
methodologies at the intersection of several fields, including
Bayesian modeling, Data Science and AI/ML and clinical trial simulation.

This session aligns closely with the pressing need for innovation in
clinical trial execution—a critical area as the biopharmaceutical
industry and research community continue to tackle complex health
challenges. By showcasing state-of-the-art statistical methods and
operational strategies, the session addresses key pain points such as
trial feasibility, site selection, patient recruitment, and drug
supply management, which are pivotal for the success of modern
clinical trials. The focus on leveraging cutting-edge analytical
methodologies, including Bayesian modeling, AI/ML, and trial
simulation, demonstrates a forward-thinking approach by integrating
expertise from multiple domains. Additionally, the emphasis on
real-world and clinical trial data ensures that the insights shared
are both practical and impactful. This session fosters collaboration
among statisticians from academia, industry, and
government—contributing to the establishment of a dynamic field of
research aimed at optimizing clinical trial processes and outcomes.

Advanced Data-Driven Statistical Technologies for Designing and Forecasting Clinical Trial Operations

In an era defined by data abundance, leveraging advanced statistical
technologies is transforming the design and forecasting of clinical
trial operations. This presentation delves into latest innovation in
data-driven approaches that optimize trial efficiency and enhance
operational decision-making. Key topics include predictive modeling
powered by machine learning to forecast patient recruitment and site
performance, and real-world data integration to support operational
feasibility and strategic planning. By coupling robust statistical
methodologies with cutting-edge AI technologies, researchers and trial
sponsors can streamline operations, reduce delays, and address
challenges such as diverse population representation and global
regulatory complexities. Real-world case studies and application
scenarios will demonstrate how these advanced tools are reshaping
clinical trial operations, fostering agility, cost management, and
ultimately improved outcomes.

Efficiency+ SWG: Data-Driven Decision Making: The Role of Statistical Modeling in
Improving Clinical Trial Success

In an era of rising development costs and intensifying competition,
improving the probability of clinical trial success is a leadership
challenge - not just a technical one. This talk reframes statisticians
as strategic partners in enterprise decision-making, moving beyond
analysis delivery to shaping how organizations design, govern, and
operate trials. I will outline how statistical leadership can help
executives:

1. Shift from retrospective reporting to forward-looking decisions
through scenario planning, early signal detection, and proactive risk
management;
2. Simplify and standardize operations by championing
fit-for-purpose designs, protocol quality by design, and reusable
analytics assets;
3. Accelerate execution by embedding statisticians
alongside clinical operations to inform country and site strategies,
enrollment predictability, and diversity-by-design;
4. Strengthen governance and accountability with clear decision rights, cycle-time
and quality metrics, and transparent evidence thresholds; and
5. Scale capability with confidence by coupling AI-enabled insights and
external real-world data with robust data stewardship, auditability,
and ethical guardrails.

Efficiency+ SWG: Integrating GenAI-Enabled Machine Learning Models for Optimization of
Clinical Trial Operations and Success Metrics

The complexity of modern clinical trials demands innovative approaches
to improve efficiency, predictability, and success rates. This
presentation examines the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) and
machine learning (ML) models into clinical trial operations, focusing
on how these technologies can transform decision-making and
performance monitoring. We will discuss frameworks for leveraging
GenAI to synthesize historical trial data, real-world evidence, and
operational metrics to generate predictive insights for enrollment
forecasting, site selection, and protocol optimization. Advanced ML
algorithms will be highlighted for their role in dynamic risk
assessment, adaptive resource allocation, and early signal detection
of operational bottlenecks. Additionally, we explore success metrics
beyond traditional endpoints — such as cycle-time reduction, diversity
compliance, and cost efficiency — and how AI-driven dashboards enable
real-time scenario planning.

Efficiency+ SWG: Emerging Software Tools for Planning and Monitoring

Efficient feasibility planning relies on robust software platforms
that support complex decision-making processes. I will focus on the
role of software tools in feasibility assessments, site selection, and
patient recruitment planning. The rapid evolution of software tools is
revolutionizing clinical trial operations, enabling more efficient
planning and monitoring processes. This presentation will explore
emerging software technologies that combine advanced statistical
methods with AI-driven analytics to enhance decision-making across the
trial lifecycle. Key features include predictive site selection
algorithms, patient recruitment monitoring dashboards, and tools for
optimizing clinical drug supply. By integrating real-world data and
clinical trial simulations, the software solutions need to provide
actionable insights that improve feasibility assessments and
streamline operational workflows. Additionally, innovations in data
visualization and automated reporting system design can facilitate
real-time tracking of trial progress, allowing teams to address
bottlenecks proactively and manage more effectively the complexity of
multi-regional clinical trials.
